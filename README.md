## Introduction
Welcome to my personal portfolio! I'm Michelle, a Full Stack Software Developer passionate about data analysis and coding. This portfolio showcases my skills, experiences, and projects, providing you with insight into my journey and capabilities.

## About Me
Greetings! üéÆ As a curiosity-driven Full-Stack Developer, I thrive on the intersection of creativity and logic. I'm on a mission to craft immersive digital experiences that captivate and inspire.

When I'm not knee-deep in code, you'll likely find me immersed in the worlds of video games, unraveling intricate puzzles, or lost in the pages of a fantastical adventure. üé≤ I'm a proud advocate for animals üêæ, an avid reader of fantasy novels üìö, and a seeker of inspiration from every corner of life.

I have a diploma in Full Stack Software development from the Code Institute, specialized in data analysis. My journey has equipped me with the skills to tackle complex problems and create innovative solutions.

I believe that hard work, a cup of tea ‚òï, and a cat üê± can solve everything. With this philosophy in mind, I approach every challenge with determination and creativity, striving to make a positive impact in the world of technology.
